1.Write the Pseudocode to Calculate the sum of digits of the number given by user
	Eg: 456=4+5+6=15
 
2. Write the Pseudocode to calcualte the area of a rectangle, square and circle
 
3. Write the Pseudocode to calculate the average of 5 marks accepted from user. If the average is between 75-90 print excellent, 
60-75 print good and 45-60 pass below 45 fail


1.Algorithm

Intiliaze the three variables with int data type
assign them values 
declare a "result" variable to store the sum of three
print the sum of three variables

#Pseudo Code
START
  res ← 0
  INPUT number
  WHILE number > 0
    digit = number % 10
    res = res + digit
    number = number // 10
  END WHILE LOOP
  PRINT res
END



2)Algorithm

Rectangle:

Get the length and width from the user.
Calculate the area using the formula area = length * width.
Print the area.

Square:

Get the side length from the user.
Calculate the area using the formula area = side * side.
Print the area.

Circle:

Get the radius from the user.
Calculate the area using the formula area = π * radius * radius.
Print the area

#Pseudo Code
rec:
START
  INPUT length, width
  area ← length * width
  PRINT area
END

square:
START
  INPUT side
  area ← side * side
  PRINT area
END

circle:
START
  INPUT radius
  area ← π * radius * radius
  PRINT area
END

3)Algorithm
Initialize a var sum to 0.
Get 5 marks from the user and add each to sum.
Calculate the average using the formula average = sum / 5.
If average is between 75 and 90, print "Excellent".
Else if average is between 60 and 75, print "Good".
Else if average is between 45 and 60, print "Pass".
Else print "Fail".

#Pseudo Code

START
  sum = 0
  FOR i FROM 1 TO 5 DO
    INPUT mark
    sum = sum + mark
  END FOR
  average = sum / 5
  IF average >= 75 AND average <= 90 THEN
    PRINT "Excellent"
  ELSE IF average >= 60 AND average < 75 THEN
    PRINT "Good"
  ELSE IF average >= 45 AND average < 60 THEN
    PRINT "Pass"
  ELSE
    PRINT "Fail"
  END IF
END
