1. Why do we use loops in programming languages?
2. Diff. between while and do...while loops?
3. How to represents loops in the algorithms?

1) Loops are the fundamental construct for programing languages
  > loops that allows us to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition
  > Like When ever we are doing any logic programs and any other number programs
  > Loops are plays a cruial role in that time

2) while:
  > it check the condition and if the condition is true then it enters the inside
    the while loop
 Do While :
  > firstly it execute the do block of code and then check the while condition
  > even if the condition is false from the beginning of the code

3)Loops in algorithms are typically represented using pseudocode, which is a high-level description of the steps an algorithm performs. Here are examples of how while and do...while loops can be represented in pseudocode
